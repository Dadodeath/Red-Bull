				<p>Javier Bonet Gonz√°lez, better known as Bnet, won at the WiZink Center in Madrid an International Final of Red Bull Battle of the Roosters which he arrived at the last moment, as he entered as a substitute when two participants were out because of visa problems.</P>

		<p>The story was repeated for him, he already lived something similar in the National Final of Spain of 2018. This time he also ended up winning.</p>
		<h1>Bnet is crowned Red Bull International Champion Battle of the Rooster</h1>

			  <p>Thousands of fans listened to each verse as if it were the last one on the night that Bnet has won the International Final of Red Bull Battle of the Roosters, the most important freestyle rap competition in the world.</P>

		<p>The Spaniard faced the Colombian Valles-T in the final battle and took her after an epic showdown in which the jury needed a replica to determine the winner.</p>

		<p>"This title is not just for me, it is for all the MCs that started on the street. For me it is the culmination of the work of so many years," Bnet said minutes after taking the title.</p>
			<h1>Meet Zone, the DJ of the International Final</h1>
			<img src="images/1574843182_dj_alcazone_final_internacional.jpg" width="800" height="300" alt=""/>
			<p>The Argentine Rodrigo Andrada, aka Zone, will be in charge of launching the beats that will animate the international final of Red Bull Battle of the Roosters on November 30 in Madrid.</p>
					<p>One of the artistic works that goes unnoticed and that, however, is one of the most important is that of the beatmakers in the freestyle battles. Zone does not tire of claiming the role of deejay, which is not reduced to puncturing bases and scratching discs, but is part of the show in the same way as MCs or hosts. It is one more piece of gear that sustains the tempo and emotion of each battle.</p>
